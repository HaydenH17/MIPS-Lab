The instructions are stored in memory, and are accessed by using the address where they are stored.  You can think of memory like a giant hotel for our data.  Each piece of data is an integer, and gets stored in a room (memory location), which we can find by its room number (memory address).  To get a piece of data, like an instruction, stored in memory we need to take its address, go to that location, and grab the value.  A bunch of memory locations, accessed by an address is called an array.
